# Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

This book is dedicated to all the people involved in building and maintaining R and the R packages we use in this book. A special thanks to the developers and maintainers of R base, the tidyverse, data.table, and the caret package.

A special thanks to my tidyverse guru David Robinson and Amy Gill for dozens of comments, edits, and suggestions. Also, many thanks to Stephanie Hicks who twice served as a co-instructor in my data science classes and Yihui Xie who patiently put up with my many questions related to markdown. Thanks also to Karl Broman, from whom I borrowed ideas for the Data Visualization and Productivity Tools parts. Thanks to Peter Aldhous from whom I borrowed ideas for the principles of data visualization section and Jenny Bryan for writing *Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*, which influenced our Git chapters. Also, many thanks to Jeff Leek, Roger Peng, and Brian Caffo, whose class inspired the way this book is divided and to Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham for making the markdown code for their R for Data Science book open. Finally, thanks to Alex Nones for proofreading the manuscript during its various stages.

This book was conceived during the teaching of several applied statistics courses, starting over fifteen years ago. The teaching assistants working with me throughout the years made important indirect contributions to this book. The latest iteration of this course is a HarvardX series coordinated by Heather Sternshein and Zofia Gajdos. We thank them for their contributions. We are also grateful to all the students whose questions and comments helped us improve the book. The courses were partially funded by NIH grant R25GM114818. We are very grateful to the National Institutes of Health for its support.
